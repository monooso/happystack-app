## Happy Stack

Happy Stack monitors the services a website depends on. It was designed and developed in under 10 weeks, from initial idea to launch. The intention was to make a fortune and retire young, but that failed miserably. So here's the code, for anyone that's interested.

The application automatically monitors over 250 services, using first-party APIs, status feeds, and web scraping. Each project has a live dashboard displaying the status of monitored services, and automated notifications with scheduling rules.

Happy Stack was built using [the TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/). It should be easy enough to get up and running if you're familiar with Laravel. Open an issue if you run into problems, and I'll try to help. That said, I don't even have PHP installed on my machine any more, so set your expectations accordingly.
