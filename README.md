## Happy Stack

Happy Stack monitors the services a website depends on. It automatically monitors over 250 services, using first-party APIs, status feeds, and web scraping. Each project has a live dashboard displaying the status of monitored services, and automated notifications with scheduling rules.

### Tech stack
Happy Stack uses [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/), and the [the TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/). The easiest way to get up-and-running is with [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail). It should work fine with Valet and Homestead, but I haven't tried.
